# DesignPatterns
Some Creational , Structure and Behavioural Design Patterns are respectively covered

# 🎯 Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are classified into three main categories:

- **Creational Patterns** – Deal with object creation mechanisms.
- **Structural Patterns** – Focus on the composition of classes or objects.
- **Behavioral Patterns** – Handle communication and responsibility among objects.

## 🧱 Creational Design Patterns

These patterns abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and reusable.

### 🔹 Singleton
Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.

### 🔹 Factory Method
Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### 🔹 Abstract Factory
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 🔹 Builder
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### 🔹 Prototype
Creates new objects by copying an existing object (known as the prototype), rather than creating new instances from scratch.

---

## 🏗️ Structural Design Patterns

These patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

### 🔹 Adapter
Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect, allowing classes to work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### 🔹 Decorator
Dynamically adds new behavior or responsibilities to an object without modifying its structure.

---

## 🔁 Behavioral Design Patterns

These patterns focus on communication between objects and how responsibilities are distributed.

### 🔹 Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
